**Welcome to Vaccinapp!**

Vaccinapp is a project I completed for my **Data Structures class at the University of Florida!** The application is **Command-Line based and coded in C++**

Vaccinapp finds the closest COVID-19 vaccination sites to you using your GPS coordinates. Vaccinapp uses either a Min Heap or an Ordered Map to geolocate the closest vaccination sites in your vicinity.

With Vaccinapp, you can:
1. Find the closest vaccination sites using a Min Heap
2. Find the closest vaccination sites using an Ordered Map
3. Compare the time it took to find the closest sites using a Min Heap versus an Ordered Map
4. Retrieve the current User GPS coordinates
5. Edit the current GPS coordinates

and **MUCH** more!


Vaccinapp was developed using open sourced data found here: https://www.vaccinespotter.org/api/
